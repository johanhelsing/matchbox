# flecs_matchbox

A [`Flecs-Rust`](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust) integration for the `matchbox` WebRTC networking library.

This crate provides a simple, resource-based API to add peer-to-peer WebRTC networking to your `Flecs-Rust` application, making it easy to create web-based multiplayer games and applications.

It is heavily inspired by the [`bevy_matchbox`](https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox/tree/main/bevy_matchbox) crate and follows its API design closely.
